with my poor writing skills that may or may not have
gone a tiny wittle bit rusty teehee. In this very blog,
it will be pretty much on the anime and manga aesthetics, reviews and 
some poetry stuff that I wrote. So I found this manga a few months back 
and i think this is worth a review and there might even be some spoilers 
ahead so watch out! Without further ado, 
let's get on with the first ever manga review on this blog~<br>

<center><pre><font color="white"><b>&hearts; SYNOPSIS &hearts;</b></pre></font></center>
<center><p align="center"><font face="arial" font color ="crimson"> Kanata and his two friends Tokiji and Shizuku are ordinary teenagers living in modern age in Japan. One day, mysterious deaths have begun to occur in their city, where the victim's head will turn into that of an animal, kill and eat people and eventually explode. 
There are a couple of rumors about the strange phenomenon and one day, one of Kanata's schoolmates turned into of the victim. 
Kanata is caught up in the incident and his abnormal ability 'awake and asleep' got exposed to an organization named External Information that is in charged of dealing with the strange incidents. 
He encounters Shiki, a mysterious, beautiful woman in a black skin-tight combat suit. She influences and forces Kanata to become deeply involved with the incidents due to his abnormal ability. 
A world-spanning conspiracy begins to unfold before Kanata's eyes and humanity's fate lies in his hands.</font></center>

<center><pre><font color="white"><b>&hearts; CHARACTERS &hearts;</b></pre></font></center>

<center><p align="center"><font face="arial" font color ="crimson">The characters were introduced and developed quite well throughout the manga from the very beginning until the climax of the manga. Kanata and Shiki's (the heroine, obviously) 
character development were the second thing that kept me interested in the manga aside from the arcs. Kanata was introduced to be this typical carefree character with abnormal ability that doesnt really care about anything other than having fun with his friends, 
plus he often uses his abnormal ability to cheat on his exams in school until several strange and grotesque deaths started to occur in the town that he began to use his ability for good and improving it. Shiki, on the other hand had a rough childhood where she was 
trained and put through soldier-like training to prepare herself for battles. She then lost her arm and her older sister which made her to grow cold with everyone she works with and often thinks only of herself. However, she gradually soften up, showing more emotions 
and trusting people around her especially, Kanata. To be honest, I kinda called it that Shiki was gonna soften up a bit the moment Kanata showed up in her life, I mean it's kinda obvious and I'm not saying it's a bad thing, it's just cliche. I appreciate the extra effort of the 
author where every characters be it the villains or heroes, every each one of them had their past that explained why they did what they did in the manga which makes the characters feel alive and realistic where they make mistakes and do things driven by emotions just like real 
human beings would do.

<center><p align="center"><font face="arial" font color ="crimson">
Just when I thought I had the whole manga figured out because of the first arc where it's pretty similar to Kiseijuu/Parasyte but no, this manga showed me more than to be associated with Kiseijuu and how wrong I was. I genuinely think that Okitenemuru is more interesting and
versatile as it offers more arcs compared to Kiseijuu (A/n: This is my opinion I didnt enjoy Kiseijuu that much to be honest.) The gore and bloody scenes are 8/10 as everything is well drawn and in detailed. I like the manga art style and would love to see other manga that its art has similar
vibe or style as this.</center></font>

<center><pre><font color="white"><b>&hearts; OVERALL THOUGHTS & RATING &hearts;</b></pre></font></center>
<center><p align="center"><font face="arial" font color ="crimson">
There is no such thing in this world that is considered as perfect. Holes, mistakes and misunderstandings are completely normal as long as we learn from it as a lesson. Okitenemuru is not near either perfection or imperfection. It's just great and nice as it is though improvements 
can still be made. I cant deny the plot holes and non existing answers to some of my questions that I had upon completing the manga. Like how (SPOILERS ALERT) Tokiji is alive and goes back to his human form when he had parasyte planted in him and his head even transformed into that 
of a giraffe's. The first 2-3 victims that had the same fate as Tokiji died after a few hours. I know that the organization did delay his death but how did they cure him? Did Kanata find the vaccine? Did the organization makes the antidote? This wasnt explained at all iirc because I 
remember seeing Tokiji at the end of the manga in his human form. I need an answer to this qnq but overall I'm quite satisfied with the ending. Reading Okitenemuru was one hell of a journey filled with emotions especially remembering the deaths in this manga. I would definitely reread 
and recommend this to peeps who wants to read something that isnt heavy, straightforward and doesnt required much thinking of a 'hidden meaning' behind every panel.<br>
